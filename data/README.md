# FIFA Dataset Setup

Download the "FIFA 22 Complete Player Dataset" from Kaggle and extract the CSV files into this directory. The project expects the yearly player files named:

- `players_15.csv` ... `players_22.csv` for the male rosters.
- `female_players_16.csv` ... `female_players_22.csv` for the female rosters.

If the dataset provides different filenames, update `data/file_map.yml` accordingly (see repository root for details).
